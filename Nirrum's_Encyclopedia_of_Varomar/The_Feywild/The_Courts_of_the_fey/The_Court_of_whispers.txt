====== The Court of whispers ======
Created Saturday 15 August 2020

Tucked in the nightways and moonlit parts of the feywild, behind  Sprawling thin-branched trees is the realm of the court of whispers. The complexes that house the fey here are suited to their myriad plots and schemes and plans.

==== The Library of Lies ====
	The library of lies is a maze of woven Cypress trees and filled with tomes, scrolls, books, tablets, and other strange media for recording history. However, nothing in the library of lies is functionally true. It is a record **of** lies, told by either the fey or the people they manipulate. They keep extensive track and keep all of their stories documented so they can build up great catastrophes or spurts of growth as they choose. If you find a lie in this library, you are then certain that it is a lie that was told, these are annotated in the event that the lies are accidentally true.  The library lies within a stageroad, so there is always light by which to read. The Library is kept by The Horachibald
	
	**The Horachibald (ISTJ) **Court of Whispers, Archfey, (Fey sorcerer, whispers, 9)
		This mossy-backed warden does not appreciate undocumented lies in the library
			Height: 10'2
			Influence: 19 Deception (intelligence), A web of falsehoods that create no less that 12 paradoxes that seem to be solved within the falsehoods but aren't is enough to confound this one.
		A Triagular, deer-like cycloptic skull sports a single baleful lidless yellow eye upon its forehead. Upon this skull ther eis no skin, there are  no lips around the grinning,  toothy, mouth that sits tucked against the being's neck. Two long 8even-fingered (and a thumb) hands sit at the ends of very long forearms, clad in teal, clammy skin. The forearms attach to a slightly shorter length of upper arm which is anchored somewhere behind the thick mat of moss that constitutes the creature's body. The Horachibald carries a lantern on the end of a long scythe-like staff, with a gnarled but rather direct jut of wood where the blade would be. A small grinning pixie is chained to the staff and holds up the lantern in its hands. The Horachibald is the only entity in the library of lies that is not highlighted by the stageroad lights. If someone climbs to the top of the shelves and stacks of the library, one can usually spot the staff of the Horachibald as it wanders. The Horachibald is helpful, but cautious. For every question asked of the Horachibald, the demanded return is immediate, "Why do you want to know? And No lying". The Horachibald's voice is somewhat deep but silky and without vocal fry. It smells of autumn forest, of wet rotting leaves and lifeless limbs. The Breath of the Horachibald is chilly, and delivers an impression that one should hurry with their tasks to prepare for winter.
			

==== The Mistaken Well ====
	This pool of ink is filled with liquid illusion magic, the sort that jolts a mind. The fey use this to craft mistakes and flaws when they need to.  The thin, oily liquid tricks the senses, any sense, into being wrong. The power of the stuff is weak, but it does not need to be strong if it is well applied. It can also be used as a splendid indigo pigment, which, strangely seems blue in sunlight, but purple in most artificial lights. This does not appear to a be a magical property. The Well is guarded by **The Weyser rybe. **
	
	**The Weyser Rybe (ENFJ) **Whispers, Archfey (Behir stats, breath weapon induces sleep instead, see spell)
		Length: 22'6
		Influence:: 13 Sleight of Hand (Wisdom) A quick check of your own thoughts will catch the rybe  within them as it messes about.
	The Weyser Rybe is a long, thick, snake-like entity, who bears a clam instead of a head. The eyes of the clam glow and change color as the Weyser Rybe communicates,. The Scales of the Weyser rybe are blue, with regular brown spots in two pairs of two lines on either side of its back. Its belly scales are black. When the Rybe attacks, a harpoon-like spike emerges from the clamshell along with two picer-like manidbles for pulling things onto the spike. The Rybe speaks in a deep, masculine voice but if the voice is loud enough, the echo will be feminine. The Weyser Rybe Requires a favour in order to allow outsiders to take from the mistaken well, but that favour must be a favour from another fey, what the Weyser Rybe will do with it, it will never reveal if unbound. If the Weyser Rybe is bound, it will reveal that it uses these favours to attack other plots to disrupt them

==== The Ambition Chiller ====
	This cave is adorned with long rods of glass cylinders  extending parallel to eachother inside  of a loing corridor. Nestled between the rods, held into place by adhesive, are droplets of enchantment magic based oil. This thick and sticky tar like substance is tansparent and yellowish
