====== The Court Of Swords ======
Created Sunday 23 August 2020

Along the shores of one of the fey oceans, often ducking in and out of it, are the most common places to find the facilities of the court of swords. Seasons pass exceptionally quickly in the Sword lands, though time often seems to stand completely still

==== The Temple Spa of the Rigid Baron ====
	Carved into the steep slope of of a short mountain range  covered in rigid coniferous trees  that flower in bright Lilly-like flowers  when magic is cast nearby is a orange-and-grey temple that from which rises many plumes of steam. The mountains face a bay in the late afternoon fey. The crescent mouthed bay hold grey waters that are around 17 celcius. The wind that blows up the mountain is cool and bracing. The temple is composed of many parts. The main hall, where a statue of the rigid baron overlooks wrestlers, acrobats, and on occasion, some other, rather masochistic practices, such as fey sitting in sconces. Behind the main hall are hot springs, fed by the boiling falls, and cold falls, fed by the freezing spring. Here, any injury can be healed. With the permission of the Rigid Baron, Any being can have their shape remade within the scope of their power.  For fey, this requires favour, for non-fey, this requires hard work maintaining the temple equal in experience to half of the mortal's life so far, Thankfully, where this is the feywild, that doesn't take long.  There are many stone meditation platforms where folk can go to become inspired, to reflect, or to exercise. **The Rigid Baron** is the keeper of the temple spa and its abbot and head trainer
