====== The Court of Terror ======
Created Monday 24 August 2020





**The Enamel Scale** (INFJ) Court of Terror, Fey Snake/Mirage Dragon, (Green dragon Wyrmling stats, minus fly speed + a fear/hallucination skill?)
Height, or more accurately length: 45 ft
Influence: 18 Medicine (Wisdom), you must identify the wisdom teeth among the scales
Description: A giant snake, scaled in teeth, with opaque solid pink eyes, which resides in a circular pool of water, whoâ€™s surface is never disturbed, regardless of what falls in or touches it. Her scales are patterned ever so slightly, similar to those of an albino ball python, with yellow and white teeth alternating to form the pattern. Her own teeth are a collection of mammalian carnivore teeth. The pool floor itself is littered in cast-off blackened, rotted teeth, though the pool is never clouded by the muck. Humanoids who still have their wisdom teeth when they encounter her owe the serpent a favour, however they can annul it by offering the teeth up.



==== Cauldrona Canyon ====
	Entering this canyon is a spiritual journey, as many places in the feywild are. It is one of the few places where 90 degree angles get you their expected results.  The Canyon is the work of a being called **Gran-nan, **who is the **Archfey of Old Traumas. **The Cauldrona Canyon is only a mile long and filled with magical Rain. The rain falls in thick blots that obscure any form of vision, hearing, tremorsense or blindsight.  **Gran-nan **guards, or rather, lives next to **The hole in your dreams.** A stone Dias next to **Gran-nan's House** marks the location of the hole. The rain never falls on the dias, and if one looks upward, the hole in the clouds reveals an inky black abyss. Staring into, listening for, attempting to smell, or reaching for the hole reveals the exact location of all major elements of each individuals own worst memories in their most consistent form. The person who killed one's parents, the corpse of a spider that crawled across one's face, the house one was born in, the house one died in, the house one left part of themselves behind and what remains of that. The parts of the memory can be explored and selected. The less horrible the memory, the less clear it is. This interaction can instantly cure and repair Retrograde //and// Anterograde amnesia, among other long-term memory disorders, curses, and spells. A person can choose one feature of their memory, even obscure or metaphysical aspects and be given a clear and understandable location. If there are special instructions required to enter a location, the map will provide one option, though not necessarily how to achieve it. It is not cryptic, but it does not solve problems. A specific pattern of actions required to unlock a spell is easy, but the response to getting to a floating island is simply "fly". The memory of this location and these instructions remains permanently clear so long as nothing interferes with the memory of the trauma which also remains clear and so long as the object or concept is present in a meaningful form. 
	
	
	
	**The Cauldrona Experience:**
		within a few moments of entering the canyon safely, the party will first smell rotting and putrefying flesh, 
		As they progress, the source of the smell becomes apparent, a large elk-like creature lies with most but not all of its pure white fur eaten away, exposing its flesh. 
			its eyes, which are on the sides of its head are permanently open with one of them staring at the party. The same side of its face has been chewed away revealing its row of sharp teeth, Something black drips from its lips (it's tar)
			It is writhing very visibly with maggots, which begin hissing if the party comes close at all. If anyone comes even closer, the maggots begin crying, a sound not unlike human children
			If the party interacts with the corpse in any way, the body thrashes, then stands up, lets out a pained bleat  and runs off into the rain with a movespeed of 60, and it uses its dash. 180t later it slams its head into a wall, dashing its brains on a stone and continues to attempt this if stopped.
		As the path progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that the cliff walls that line the canyon contain fossilized children of many races en masse, some of them reach out from the wall, their tiny hands skeletonized. Among the children's skeletons, are larger, giant skeletons of horrible proportions. Many of the smaller skeletons lie  where the guts would have been in these larger ones
			Against one wall there is a fully adult hand reaching out from the shoulder of a barely visible infantile skeleton barely hidden behind translucent stone. The hand is fresh and a backpack and bedroll are on the ground. If disturbed, cockroaches erupt from both and scatter, often remaining hidden among the party's belongings (attaching to an item and remaining imperceptible until that item is inspected or used)
		Along the centre of the canyon, a solid, uninterrupted and uniform strip of stone serves as a path emerging from stony rubble, a ditch with muddy water flows alongside. Drinking the water gives one a rather acidic and metallic taste. Should anyone spit out the water, a small black tadpole attempts to squirm back into the river, where it becomes undetectable, a faint smell of smoke is on the wind.
			shortly after the road begins, sheltered under a tree are three fresh elven bodies, one with a mutilated face that is lacerated with glass around the destroyed maxilla, one lying down writhing with black tadpoles that crawl out from holes all over their skin, in particular around their face which is unrecognizable from the holes which never seem to overlap, and one kneeling over it with a shortword buried in their stomach. From the wound of the kneeling elf, more black tadpoles writhe and as the party looks, their eye erupts and another tadpole falls out onto the ground, trying to squirm toward the river. There are four bedrolls and four adventurer's kits on the ground. Their fire is still smouldering, their wood too wet to catch in its current state. 
		The road-like strip stops abruptly with a change of elevation, with the ground rising quickly nearly 4 feet. A nearly perfect round pit sinks into the ground. The pit has no known bottom. around the pit is a steep clay bank, about three feet  high. The pit is easy to avoid but one can't look *down* the pit any signficant distance without being on the crumbly slope. There is a DC 5 Acrobatics check to not slip  and a DC 5 Athletics check to not fall in after slipping. A character that falls in the hole is stuck there without aid from something that can fall faster than it does or something that can teleport.
			Behind the top of the  rise, A sleepy goat rests. If a character climbs the ledge, the goat panics and attacks the character in a surprise round (provided it is not already spotted), trying to use its charge attack. Instead of knocking the player prone, the goat pushes them toward (and if possible into) the pit, where they make the same saves described above. A character that is unaware of the goat that gets a higher initiative gets advantage on the save.
			If no one is looking at the pit, a scuffing sound can be heard followed by a feminine scream that quickly fades, as if something had fallen in. A broken foot-long campfire skewer rests on the bank of the pit.
